<h1>🍕PizzaSpeckata</h1>
This is a school project for a website on a imaginary pizza restaurant.
My pizza restaurant is called PizzaSpeckata, with a fancy menù, exclusive and selected ingridients, situated in Treviso, Italy. (the website is entirely in italian language)

<h1>📍The Process</h1>
After seeing a lot of pizza restaurants website here in italy i come to a conclusion that they're all the same layout, so i wanted to change the thing to my site and create a unique one with a lot more animations and images to see what you're gonna buy 
(some pizza's in this case). <br>
I used a simple layout but also elegant and fancy, a simple description of the brand, right above the ingirident list (with a clickable button to see out ingridients and how luxury they are), 
and then the menù with 10 different type of simple pizza's but with unique ingridient to make them special in our way. <br>
And then after doing a simple layout for all the pages i used a CSS file to styling the pages in a elegant but always simple way to mantain the page easy to read.
